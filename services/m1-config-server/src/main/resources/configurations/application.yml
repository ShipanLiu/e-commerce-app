# application.yml in the Config Server will act as a shared base configuration.
# All other service-specific configuration files (e.g., customer-service.yml, discovery-service.yml, product-service.yml) will inherit settings from application.yml by default.


#    --------------Config for eureka service-----------


# Define a custom port property
custom:
  eureka:

# Act as a eureka-client and connect to eureka(discovery)server:

# Act as a eureka(discovery)server for other ms, this eureka discovery server call be shown in a webclient when accessing the "http://127.0.0.1:9092/"
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${custom.eureka.port}/eureka/  # Corrected port to 9092
  register-with-eureka: true
  fetch-registry: true  # e.g. customer-service retrieves the list of services registered with Eureka, including order-service.

spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      override-system-properities: false  #For example, if you have an environment variable DATABASE_URL set on the system and the Config Server also has a DATABASE_URL property, the systemâ€™s value will be used, not the one from the Config Server.
